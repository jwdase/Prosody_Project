# Prosody Project
Simple Goal: To create a NN that is capable of recognizing language solely through prosody 

## What is Prosody
Prosody refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns of speech - the musical aspects of language. 

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intonation (F0 contour)** | Pitch movement over an utterance—the “melody” of speech. |
| **Stress** | Relative prominence of syllables via amplitude, duration, and pitch accents. |
| **Rhythm / Timing** | Temporal patterning of syllables, pauses, and phrase boundaries. |
| **Loudness** | Overall intensity profile shaping perceived emphasis and phrasing. |


## Why is this important
We're looking to disprove the Null Hypothesis that languages all have the same prosody using scientific evidence
